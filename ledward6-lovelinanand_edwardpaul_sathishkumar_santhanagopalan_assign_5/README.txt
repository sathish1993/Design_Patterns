Provide justification for Data Structures used in this assignment in
term of Big O complexity (time and/or space)

Data Structures:

Tree:
	Insertion & Search Time complexity: O(log n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree
	Insertion & Search Space complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree


ArrayList:
	Insertion & Other manipulations Time and Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the size of the list

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Provide list of citations (urls, etc.) from where you have taken code
(if any).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
PRINT_RESULT, WORD_ADD, WORD_VISIT
Debug Level:
case 3: DebugLevel.WORD_VISIT;
  Whenever a visit functions is called

case 2: DebugLevel.WORD_ADD;
	Whenever a new word is added into tree

case 1: DebugLevel.PRINT_RESULT;
	When the output result has to be printed in console
