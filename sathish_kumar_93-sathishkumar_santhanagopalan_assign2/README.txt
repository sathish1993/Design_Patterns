Provide justification for Data Structures used in this assignment in
term of Big O complexity (time and/or space)

Data Structures:

Tree:
	Insertion & Search Time complexity: O(log n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree
	Insertion & Search Space complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree


ArrayList:
	Insertion & Other manipulations Time and Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the size of the list

Observer Pattern Implementation: 

When a course has to be deleted. we remove it from the course arraylist and call notifyObservers(). 
For all observers associated to the original node, we call update(), which in turn removes the 
required course from the backup nodes.
