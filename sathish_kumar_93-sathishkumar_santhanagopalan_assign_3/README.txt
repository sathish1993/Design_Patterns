State pattern design: //http://www.newthinktank.com/2012/10/state-design-pattern-tutorial/
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

State Pattern Implementation: 

1. Input string is read and sent to helper class to parse it.
2. Default current state is set as low
3. Invoked tightenOrLoosenSecurity() with the current state object in the Context class (Airport.java)
4. Based on the value in current state oject, corresponding state class's tightenOrLoosenSecurity() is invoked
5. New state is identified based on the input metric values and current state object in Context class is updated
6. Once the current state is set, corresponding operations are carried out
